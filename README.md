# SpinDocker

SpinDocker is a cross-platform desktop application that visualizes images, containers and multi-container apps. The goal of the app is to solve issues regarding lack of support for Docker compose and visualizing multi-container apps.

## Simple and fast visualization
SpinDocker allows for quickly composing up and down multi-container apps, while keeping track of containers that are offline or currently running
with an easy to access control side bar.

## Saved directories
Composing apps from .yml files can be time consuming due to constantly changing directories. With SpinDocker developers and non-developers can simply save directories where their projects are located for easy app startup.

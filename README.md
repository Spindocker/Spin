# Spin
Because Docker is in wide use at the enterprise level by many professionals from developers to I.T. technicians, thereâ€™s a strong use case for an easy-to-use and effective Docker GUI. However, the most heavily utilized Docker GUI lacks Docker Compose functionality. Seeing that Compose is a critical component of the Docker ecosystem, we sought to remedy this problem.

Spin is a cross-platform desktop application that visualizes images, containers and multi-container apps. The goal of the app is to solve issues regarding lack of support for Docker compose and visualizing multi-container apps.

## Simple and fast visualization
Spin allows for quickly composing up and down multi-container apps, while keeping track of containers that are offline or currently running
with an easy to access control side bar.

## Saved Directories
Composing apps from .yml files can be time consuming due to constantly changing directories. With Spin developers and non-developers can simply save directories where their projects are located for easy app startup.
